1) HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1

The request loads one after another,so if the request can't load then it blocks all other request behind it .

HTTP2 

Here the Request loads as a single TCP connection to send all request at similar time so no request blocks the behind request.


2) Object 
  	In javascript object is not same as other primitive data type like(Number, Boolean, Null, undefined, String). 
	Where Variable refers to value do not actually store the value, it actually a reference of a value which acts as
	a reference or pointer that points to the location in the memory where the object is stored.
					Object is the combination of primitive data type and reference data in the 
	form of  key:value , pairs.
